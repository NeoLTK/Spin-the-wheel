For me he takes people for fools with their false path to fortune, just to generate more traffic on their site, and make money under a pretext of totally false reward
so I created a bot, which spins the wheel for you.

You obviously have to configure a random launch every day to avoid getting caught

all the actions performed by the bot are random, always to be safe

the SemiHendless.ps1 script is more intended for the reference repository, it opens all windows under a different desktop, allows you to fill in the captchas when they are displayed instead of giving you an error that requires you to modify the bot configuration so that the handless world is deactivated at the next launch.
